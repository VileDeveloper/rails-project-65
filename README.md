## Bulletin Board

Bulletin Board offers an online platform as an alternative to traditional classified ad platforms. Users have the ability to create and browse advertisements, interact with listings, and communicate with sellers. All advertisements are subject to pre-moderation by the platform's administrators, who can choose to request revisions, publish the ads, or move them to an archive.
